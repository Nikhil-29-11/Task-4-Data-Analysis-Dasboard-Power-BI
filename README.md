## Questions
🔍 Attrition Overview
- What is the overall attrition rate in the company, and how does it compare to industry benchmarks?
- Has the attrition rate changed over time or remained consistent?

👥 Demographics & Age
- Which age group shows the highest attrition, and why might that be the case?
- Does average age correlate with years of service or job level?

👨‍🔬 Job Role Specifics
- Which job roles experience the highest attrition and what common patterns are seen?
- Are any job roles showing unusually low attrition? Why?

💰 Compensation Analysis
- How does attrition correlate with salary slabs? Are employees in lower salary brackets leaving more often?
- Is there a critical salary threshold below which attrition spikes?

🎓 Educational Background

- Can training or career development be tailored to reduce attrition in those segments?

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Gender Trends
- Is there a significant difference in attrition between male and female employees?
- Do certain job roles have gender-skewed attrition?

📈 Tenure-Based Insights
- At what point in their tenure are employees most likely to leave?
- What measures can be taken to improve employee engagement in the first 2 years?

🧩 Strategic & Predictive
- What are the key drivers of attrition based on this data?
