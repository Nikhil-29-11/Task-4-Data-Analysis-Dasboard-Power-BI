## 🔍 Project Insight
The HR Analytics project revealed significant insights into the company’s employee attrition trends. With a recorded attrition rate of 16.2%, the analysis highlights a critical need for strategic intervention. The majority of employees leaving the organization fall within the 26–35 age group, indicating a need to address the expectations and career aspirations of younger professionals. A strong correlation was observed between lower salary brackets (particularly those earning ≤ 5K) and higher attrition rates, emphasizing the importance of competitive compensation. Additionally, certain job roles such as Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives experienced disproportionately high turnover, which may be attributed to high job stress, limited career progression, or lack of role satisfaction.

Another notable insight is that most attrition occurs during the first one to two years of employment. This suggests gaps in onboarding processes, early employee engagement, and alignment between job expectations and reality. Interestingly, educational background also plays a role—employees with Life Sciences and Medical degrees are more likely to leave, possibly indicating a mismatch between their qualifications and job responsibilities.

These findings point to the need for targeted retention strategies, such as improved onboarding, revised compensation models, role-specific development plans, and personalized employee engagement programs. Addressing these factors will not only help reduce attrition but also improve overall organizational performance and employee satisfaction.

# ✅ Final Conclusion
The HR Analytics project has successfully uncovered critical patterns related to employee attrition, offering valuable insights for organizational improvement. The analysis confirms that the company faces a notable attrition rate of 16.2%, with the majority of employees exiting within the first two years of employment. This trend suggests that early engagement, onboarding effectiveness, and initial job satisfaction are key areas that require attention.

A deeper look into the data reveals that employees in the 26–35 age group are most likely to leave, highlighting a need to cater to the career growth, development, and expectations of this demographic. Additionally, employees earning ≤ 5,000 in monthly salary exhibit the highest turnover, indicating that compensation and perceived value play a significant role in employee decisions to stay or leave.

Specific job roles, including Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives, were identified as high-risk for attrition. These roles may be experiencing burnout, lack of advancement opportunities, or external market pull factors. Moreover, individuals with backgrounds in Life Sciences and Medical fields are more frequently leaving the organization, pointing toward a possible mismatch between skills and role expectations.

In summary, the findings call for a strategic response focused on retention. This includes enhancing salary structures for entry-level roles, improving onboarding experiences, and creating clear career pathways—especially for roles with high attrition. By taking data-driven, proactive steps, the organization can improve retention, strengthen employee satisfaction, and build a more stable and engaged workforce.
